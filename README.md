# infinite_series

### Exploring c's boundaries.

Why c; you might well ask? No desires to reinvent the wheel here, quite simply
fascinated by Pi and a little infinity. Now it would seem to me that counting
with c is somewhat closer to counting with -1/12, than to counting with real
numbers and I ask myself what might be found concealed within this mysterious
figure, a figure that envelops the real number set in all of its apparent
entirity.

The mind boggles ... and so will gcc.
